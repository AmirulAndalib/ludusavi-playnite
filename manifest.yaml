    Changelog:
      - >-
        Changed - Localization now uses Project Fluent (https://projectfluent.org) instead of pure C# code internally.
        Although English currently remains the only language supported, this change
        should make it easier for other people to contribute. If you'd like to help,
        check out the new Crowdin project (https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi-playnite).
      - >-
        Changed - The `ludusavi-skip` tag is now `[Ludusavi] Skip`.
        If you were using the old tag, it will be automatically renamed for you.
      - >-
        Removed support for erri120's extension update notifier (https://github.com/erri120/Playnite.Extensions)
        since Playnite now natively provides this functionality.
      - Added - Game-specific context menu entries to add or remove Ludusavi-related tags.
      - Added - Option to restore save data for a game before playing it.
      - Added - Option to remember your choice when asked if you want to back up a game.
      - Added - Several new tags to tweak behavior for individual games.
      - >-

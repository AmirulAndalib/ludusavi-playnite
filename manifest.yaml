  - Version: 0.17.0
    RequiredApiVersion: 6.0.0
    ReleaseDate: 2025-04-22
    PackageUrl: https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite/releases/download/v0.17.0/ludusavi-playnite-v0.17.0.pext
    Changelog:
      - >-
        Added: New option: `Require confirmation when multiple games are running`.
        This can be useful if you play multiple games at the same time that share save data
        (particularly for platform-based backups),
        so you can prevent automatic backup/restore when more than one game is running.
      - >-
        Fixed: If two games had the same plugin source and game ID,
        then the wrong game could get backed up.
      - >-
        Changed: Updated translations, including a new translation for Arabic and Indonesian.

    PackageUrl: https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite/releases/download/v0.16.0/ludusavi-playnite-v0.16.0.pext
    Changelog:
      - >-
        Added: You can now open the backup directories for multiple selected games at once.
      - >-
        Added: The plugin will notify you when an update for Ludusavi is available.
        This requires Ludusavi v0.25.0 or newer.
        The check occurs at most once per 24 hours.
      - >-
        Fixed: The plugin now uses a buffered update when changing tags.
        This should avoid issues where other plugins may respond to each tag change individually.

    PackageUrl: https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite/releases/download/v0.15.0/ludusavi-playnite-v0.15.0.pext
    Changelog:
      - >-
        Added: In a game's context menu, backup comments are now displayed,
        if any have been added in Ludusavi.
        If a backup is from another OS than Windows, that is also indicated.
      - >-
        Added: In a game's context menu, you can now open that game's backup directory.
        This requires Ludusavi v0.24.0 or newer.
      - >-
        Added: On startup, if Ludusavi cannot be found, then an error popup is displayed.
        This should help users who did not realize they had to install Ludusavi itself
        and who also missed the error notification.
      - >-
        Fixed: In some cases where Playnite and Ludusavi used different names for a game,
        the game's context menu would not list its backups.
        This now works properly in more cases if you use Ludusavi v0.24.0 or newer.
      - >-
        Changed: The recommended version of Ludusavi is now v0.24.0. You can download the latest release here:

    RequiredApiVersion: 6.0.0
    ReleaseDate: 2023-06-22
    PackageUrl: https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite/releases/download/v0.13.0/ludusavi-playnite-v0.13.0.pext
    Changelog:
      - >-
        Added: Ludusavi 0.18.0+: The plugin will show a notification if cloud sync fails or has a conflict.
      - >-
        Added: You can now choose not to override the backup directory and defer to Ludusavi's own configuration.
      - >-
        Added: There is an option to automatically tag games with unknown save data.
      - >-
        Changed: Ludusavi 0.18.0+: The plugin no longer sets the `--merge` flag, since it has been deprecated.
        It is still set for older Ludusavi versions.
      - >-
        Changed: Ludusavi 0.18.0+: The plugin now sets `--try-manifest-update` instead of `--try-update`.
      - >-

        (Thanks to contributors on the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi-playnite))

  - Version: 0.12.1
    RequiredApiVersion: 6.0.0
    ReleaseDate: 2023-03-19
    PackageUrl: https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite/releases/download/v0.12.1/ludusavi-playnite-v0.12.1.pext
    Changelog:
      - >-
        Fixed: If a game had multiple platforms listed in its metadata,
        then it would not trigger any automatic backups before/during/after play
        (manual backups worked as expected).
        The plugin now properly handles games with multiple platforms.
      - >-
        Fixed: When distinguishing PC and non-PC games,
        the plugin only considered the first platform listed in the game details.
        It now considers all platforms listed.
      - >-
        Fixed: On confirmation prompts, the plugin would preemptively say
        "this game requires a matching custom entry" for non-PC games.
        However, that assumption isn't always true.
        Now, the plugin just adds this message onto the error notification when Ludusavi doesn't recognize a game.
      - >-
        Fixed: If you had both game- and platform-based automatic backups enabled after play,
        then the game backup might not be done yet when the platform backup was attempted,
        resulting in the platform backup aborting.
        The plugin now waits until the game backup is done before attempting the platform backup.
      - >-
        Changed: The recommended version of Ludusavi is now 0.16.0. You can download the latest release here:
        https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/releases
      - >-
        Changed: Updated translations.

  - Version: 0.12.0
    RequiredApiVersion: 6.0.0
    ReleaseDate: 2023-02-28
    PackageUrl: https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite/releases/download/v0.12.0/ludusavi-playnite-v0.12.0.pext
    Changelog:
      - >-
        Added: An option to automatically tag games with backups. This requires Ludusavi 0.14.0 or newer.
      - >-
        Added: An option to look up games under a different name.
        This allows you to resolve Playnite/Ludusavi naming discrepancies without creating a custom entry in Ludusavi.
        Right now, this is simply a text box where you can enter the desired lookup name.
        Once Ludusavi 0.16.0 is released, it will allow the plugin to show a searchable list of Ludusavi's known titles.
      - >-
        Fixed: Games could not be backed up if they had Unicode characters in their title (e.g., "Ninja Gaiden Σ").
      - >-
        Fixed: With older versions of Ludusavi, the plugin would report that there was nothing new to back up,
        even if it did make a new backup.
  - Version: 0.11.1
    RequiredApiVersion: 6.0.0

  - Version: 0.11.0
    RequiredApiVersion: 6.0.0
    ReleaseDate: 2022-10-29
    PackageUrl: https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite/releases/download/v0.11.0/ludusavi-playnite-v0.11.0.pext
    Changelog:
      - >-
        Added: The plugin now indicates when there was nothing new to back up or restore.
        When doing a full scan, the expanded list also indicates new (+) or updated (Δ) for each game.
        This is enabled if you have Ludusavi 0.14.0 or newer.
      - >-
        Added: When backing up or restoring a specific game,
        the plugin now indicates when Ludusavi knows it by a different name.
        Example: `Backed up saves for Playnite Title (↪ Ludusavi Title)`.
        This is enabled if you have Ludusavi 0.14.0 or newer.
      - >-
        Added: An option to look up games by a normalization of their titles.
        For example, this means the plugin can retry "Some Game: Special Edition (2022)" as just "Some Game"
        if Ludusavi didn't recognize the original title.
        If the normalized title produces multiple matches, the plugin chooses the first one.
        This setting only takes effect if you have Ludusavi 0.14.0 or newer.
      - >-
        Added: Plugin settings to override the backup format, compression, and retention.
        These will still default to whatever you have configured in Ludusavi itself,
        but now you can override it from Playnite.
        These settings only take effect if you have Ludusavi 0.14.0 or newer.
      - >-
        Added: On startup, the plugin will show a one-time notification
        if a newer version of Ludusavi is recommended for the best experience.
      - >-
        Changed: When Ludusavi 0.14.0 or newer is installed, the plugin now uses the `find` command to look up games.
        As a side effect, a game's Steam ID (if applicable) is now checked before its title rather than after.
      - >-
        Changed: For compatibility with Ludusavi 0.14.0, the plugin now passes `--force` to the backup command.
        This remains compatible with older versions as well.

    Changelog:

        Added: Support for multiple backups per game. This requires Ludusavi 0.12.0 or newer.

      - >-
        Fixed: Handling of games whose name begins with a hyphen.
        Previously, the plugin would not have been able to run Ludusavi for such games.
      - >-

        Previously, depending on the quote placement, the plugin may not have found

      - >-
        Changed - The plugin can now recognize when a game is on PC or Steam in more situations.
        Specifically, it now checks the game's platform name and source plugin ID as well,
        instead of just the platform specification ID and source name.

    Changelog:
      - >-
        Changed - Localization now uses Project Fluent (https://projectfluent.org) instead of pure C# code internally.
        Although English currently remains the only language supported, this change
        should make it easier for other people to contribute. If you'd like to help,
        check out the new Crowdin project (https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi-playnite).
      - >-
        Changed - The `ludusavi-skip` tag is now `[Ludusavi] Skip`.
        If you were using the old tag, it will be automatically renamed for you.
      - >-
        Removed support for erri120's extension update notifier (https://github.com/erri120/Playnite.Extensions)
        since Playnite now natively provides this functionality.

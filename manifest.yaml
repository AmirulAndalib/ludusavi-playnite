  - Version: 0.11.0
    RequiredApiVersion: 6.0.0
    ReleaseDate: 2022-10-29
    PackageUrl: https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite/releases/download/v0.11.0/ludusavi-playnite-v0.11.0.pext
    Changelog:
      - >-
        Added: The plugin now indicates when there was nothing new to back up or restore.
        When doing a full scan, the expanded list also indicates new (+) or updated (Δ) for each game.
        This is enabled if you have Ludusavi 0.14.0 or newer.
      - >-
        Added: When backing up or restoring a specific game,
        the plugin now indicates when Ludusavi knows it by a different name.
        Example: `Backed up saves for Playnite Title (↪ Ludusavi Title)`.
        This is enabled if you have Ludusavi 0.14.0 or newer.
      - >-
        Added: An option to look up games by a normalization of their titles.
        For example, this means the plugin can retry "Some Game: Special Edition (2022)" as just "Some Game"
        if Ludusavi didn't recognize the original title.
        If the normalized title produces multiple matches, the plugin chooses the first one.
        This setting only takes effect if you have Ludusavi 0.14.0 or newer.
      - >-
        Added: Plugin settings to override the backup format, compression, and retention.
        These will still default to whatever you have configured in Ludusavi itself,
        but now you can override it from Playnite.
        These settings only take effect if you have Ludusavi 0.14.0 or newer.
      - >-
        Added: On startup, the plugin will show a one-time notification
        if a newer version of Ludusavi is recommended for the best experience.
      - >-
        Changed: When Ludusavi 0.14.0 or newer is installed, the plugin now uses the `find` command to look up games.
        As a side effect, a game's Steam ID (if applicable) is now checked before its title rather than after.
      - >-
        Changed: For compatibility with Ludusavi 0.14.0, the plugin now passes `--force` to the backup command.
        This remains compatible with older versions as well.

      - >-
        Changed - Localization now uses Project Fluent (https://projectfluent.org) instead of pure C# code internally.

        check out the new Crowdin project (https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi-playnite).
      - >-
